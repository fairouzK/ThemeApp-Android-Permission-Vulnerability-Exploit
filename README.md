# Android-Permission-Vulnerability-Exploiter
The goal of the application was to be able to access the external storage of Android phones and manipulate the data, while making it seem like a legitimate Theme app, and this was successfully achieved. 

First, a splash screen appears as soon as the application is opened. It is displayed for a few seconds before a new page is displayed.
In the second activity, as there were changes to how the permissions should be requested, the page after the splash screen displays a text that says “Permission(s) Needed: Storage” and a button saying “Load Themes”. 
When the button is clicked on, a pop up message from the device is displayed requesting the user to allow the application to access its files on the device. 
If the request is denied, a message from the application pops up informing the user that the storage permission was denied, and that viewing/downloading the themes will not be possible without allowing permission. 
If the permission is granted, themes will be displayed with the option of downloading them.
After having the permission granted, the attack can start. 
The attack allowed the data in the external storage to be manipulated.
As a test, WhatsApp’s external storage was accessed, get an image and add another image on top of it, ruining the original file.
